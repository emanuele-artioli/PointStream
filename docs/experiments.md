# Experiments

## Protocol

GPU time and training are the constraint; code is cheap. Rank work by value to
the paper first and the demo second.

1. **Write it down first.** Add an entry below with the decision rule, the
   hypothesis, the competing explanation and the budget (GPU hours and wall
   time).
2. **Correctness smoke, in minutes.** The real component on a representative
   bounded input, through the same entrypoint as the full run. On a model's
   first run on a GPU class, the smoke also asserts device, execution provider
   and kernels ([fleet](fleet.md#modelgpu-table)).
3. **Bounded pilot on the one axis that matters.**
4. **Scaled run**, only after the pilot shows it can meet the target within
   budget.
5. **Stop when the decision is made.** Record the outcome below, including
   negative results.

Fleet runs follow [fleet](fleet.md): a smoke of at most 600 s, a validator with
substantive checks, sha256-identified inputs, a deadline and a budget.

**Evidence.** A number is evidence only if it names its job, code revision,
inputs and GPU, and comes from the real component, not a stand-in. Smoke runs
and stand-ins are not evidence.

**Evaluation basis.** Masks for scoring come from the datasets, never from
PointStream's own segmenter. Weighted PSNR is 0.7 foreground + 0.3 background
on dataset masks. Results are reported per provenance tier
([resources](resources.md#datasets)). Do not count correlated frames as
independent samples.

**Baselines.** SVT-AV1 and a state-of-the-art neural video codec, with exact
encoder and decoder paths and versions recorded. VVC only if a correct
invocation turns out to be needed.

## Decisions

### 2026-10-05: Evaluate on labelled data
- Decision: evaluation and training targets come from labelled datasets
  (OpenTTGames, RacketVision, TrackNet, VISOR, EgoHOS, HOT3D). SAM 3.1 fills
  only missing classes, prompted from the labels where possible. No hand
  labelling.
- Scope: racket sports and egocentric hand-object video. Non-racket sports are
  future work.
- Foreground includes the ball and the handled object.

### 2026-10-05: Baselines
- Decision: SVT-AV1 plus one state-of-the-art neural video codec. VVC only if a
  correct invocation is needed.
