# BP24 — findings that outlive this brief

Written 2026-08-27 while binding real encoders into the codec stage. These are
not the BP24 result; they are things measured on the way that change how other
work should be read.

## 1. The codec presets are not equal effort, so cross-codec numbers are unfair

`_PRESETS` in `src/components/codec/measure.py` mirrors
`experiments/headroom/ladder.py`: `avc: veryfast`, `hevc: ultrafast`,
`av1: 10`, `vvc: faster`. Those were chosen so BP21's 4K ladder would finish,
which is a legitimate reason — but they are **not comparable effort across
encoders**.

Measured on four real 960×540 frames, QPs 28/38/48, over a 13 dB overlap:

**HEVC over AVC = −4.2% BD-rate.** The literature expects **30–50%**.

x264 `veryfast` against kvazaar `ultrafast` is not a fair fight, and the
direction of the bias is predictable: it **understates the newer codec**, every
time.

**What this does and does not touch.**

- **Safe: BP21's concentration result.** It compares an original clip against a
  plate-filled clip *on the same codec at the same preset*, so the preset
  cancels. The 15–19× concentration stands.
- **Safe: BP21's retracted VVC gap.** It was already withdrawn as an
  operating-point confound; this is a second, independent reason the same
  comparison could not have been trusted.
- **Not safe: any future codec-vs-codec claim** built on these presets,
  including the P0 item 2 ladder. That is the one this brief hands forward.

**What "fair" would have to mean — and why it mostly dissolves.**

The decisive point is that **PointStream's goal is not a codec comparison.** The
claim the paper needs is *PointStream against a codec*, not *codec against
codec*. That reframing removes most of the problem:

> **Pair every arm on one codec at one preset.** For codec X, measure
> (a) X coding the source, and (b) PointStream using X for its coded components
> — same encoder, same preset, same rungs. BD-rate between those two curves *is*
> the PointStream gain, and **the preset cancels**, exactly as it cancels in
> BP21's concentration result.

So option (1) — report the preset, never compare across codecs — is not a
stopgap for the real goal. It is **sufficient and correct** for it. The paper
reports a gain per codec: "PointStream improves BD-rate over AVC by X%, over
HEVC by Y%", each measured with that codec on both arms.

**The one thing that stays off-limits:** ranking those gains against each other,
or saying "PointStream beats VVC but not AV1". Comparing the *magnitudes*
across codecs re-imports the preset unfairness through the back door. State each
gain beside its preset; do not order them.

Cross-codec fairness only becomes necessary if the paper wants a direct
codec-vs-codec line, which it does not need. That decision is parked in
`DEFERRED.md` D-CODEC-PRESETS rather than settled here.

## 2. `bd_rate`'s overlap guard is relative, so it cannot catch a flat curve

`src/components/metrics/bd_rate.py` refuses to return a number when curves
"barely overlap", which is the right instinct. But the guard is
`overlap_fraction` — a *proportion* of the quality range.

A degenerate curve defeats it. Encoding synthetic gradient-plus-noise gave a
quality span of **0.5 dB across QP 32→46** (the encoder discards incompressible
noise at every QP, so PSNR saturates). Both curves were flat, so they overlapped
almost completely: `overlap_fraction = 1.0`, and `compare_rd_curves` returned a
confident-looking BD-rate of −0.88 over a range where nothing was resolved.

**A relative guard cannot see an absolutely tiny span.** It needs an absolute
floor as well — a curve spanning under roughly 3–6 dB should refuse, whatever
its overlap fraction. `InsufficientOverlapError` already exists and is the right
place to raise from.

This did not corrupt any published number: it was caught on a synthetic anchor
during BP24. But it is exactly the shape of failure this project has had twice
before — an instrument returning a confident number over a range where it
resolves nothing.

## 3. A synthetic anchor can hide a working instrument as easily as a broken one

The flat curve above looked like broken code. It was not: the same
`coded_curve` on four real frames produced textbook curves — 42.80 → 35.02 →
28.05 dB, 14.75 dB span, monotone in rate and quality.

**The contrast is what established the instrument**, not either run alone. Noise
is incompressible, so a noise-based anchor cannot exercise a rate-quality sweep
at all; it saturates and reports nonsense in both directions. When calibrating
anything rate-related, the anchor has to be compressible the way real content
is.
